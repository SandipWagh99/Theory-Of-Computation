Topic :Write program on Pattern Searching 
We have created interactive user interface 
We are using Naive Algorithm For Pattern Searching
Steps Of Algorithm are as Follows
Step 1: Set the limit 
i.e lem]ngth of pattern which we have to find is less than length of String.
limit = N - M
N String
M = Pattern
Step 2: Check the pattern at the index
 (str[i + j]!=pat[j]
 break
 Step 3 : Print pattern found at respective Position
 if j==m
